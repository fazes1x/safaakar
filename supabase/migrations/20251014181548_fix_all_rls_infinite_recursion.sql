  # Fix All RLS Infinite Recursion Issues

  1. Changes
    - Drop all policies that query profiles table within themselves
    - Recreate simpler policies that avoid circular dependencies
    - Allow authenticated users to read data they need
    - Maintain security by checking user_id ownership

  2. Security
    - Users can only modify their own data
    - All authenticated users can read necessary data for the app to function
    - The application logic handles role-based filtering
